    <h3>Releases</h3>
    
    <p>
      Since we last had a FOSDEM stand (2019): XWiki underwent two development cycles. The <a href="https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWiki11CycleReleaseNotes">11.x cycle</a> is defined by having improved usability for users and administrators: from conflicts management to multiple login attacks protection, to inline editing for wiki macros, to improved pickers for the date, color, attachments, and pages. The <a href="https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWiki12CycleReleaseNotes">12.x cycle</a> focused on inline and real-time editing, page likes, notifications, not to mention a lot of performance updates. In total, we managed to have over 1578 issues closed: 763 bugs, 288 improvements, 79 new features, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      CryptPad had <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/">38 releases</a>. There are big improvements to the tools that are most essential to effectively coordinate distributed groups of people, namely rich text, spreadsheet, and kanban apps. The admin panel was further developed to ensure that community instances can be governed by team members.
