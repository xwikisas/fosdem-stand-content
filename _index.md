      <b>Welcome to the XWiki and CryptPad stand !</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>XWiki</b> is a powerful Open Source collaborative platform allowing organizations of all sizes to save time and money while enhancing collaboration on both team and organizational levels. Being focused on efficient communication and collaboration, XWiki redefines the value of business knowledge by allowing any user to access critical information in a fast and efficient way while reducing the organizational silos.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, more than ever the need to have access to important knowledge from wherever the world has skyrocketed. As working from home has become the norm, with an XWiki instance in place, the vital information is now easily accessible, the training and operational costs are reduced and regular backups are performed to prevent data loss. With over 700 extensions, applications, macros, skins, and plugins available, XWiki is one of the most flexible and versatile collaborative platforms out there. Moreover, App within Minutes allows even the non-technical users to create their own extensions and continue collaborating efficiently. We know businesses are different, this is why XWiki supports full customization and it is available on both Cloud and on-premise versions to fit everyone's needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being developed with the help of a community of passionate developers, XWiki is always advancing, which ensures flawless compatibility, strong security, and performant features.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>CryptPad</b> is a suite of private-by-design collaboration tools. You can use it to share rich text, spreadsheets, polls, presentations, whiteboard functions, and code. All the content stored on CryptPad is encrypted before being sent, which means nobody can access your data unless you give them the keys (not even us).
    </p>
    <p>
      With CryptPad, you can make quick collaborative documents for taking notes and writing down ideas together. When you sign up and log in, you get file upload capability and a CryptDrive where you can organize all of your pads. You can share access to a CryptPad document simply by sharing the link. Whenever you access a pad in CryptPad, the pad is automatically added to your CryptDrive in the main folder. Later on, you can organize these pads into folders or you can put them in the trash bin. CryptDrive allows you to search through your pads and to organize them whenever you want, however you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      With intuitive drag-and-drop, you can move pads around in your drive and the link to these pads will stay the same so your collaborators will never lose access. You can also upload files in your CryptDrive and share them with colleagues. Uploaded files can be organized just like collaborative pads.

    <h3>Releases</h3>
    
    <p>
      Since we last had a FOSDEM stand (2019): XWiki underwent two development cycles. The <a href="https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWiki11CycleReleaseNotes">11.x cycle</a> is defined by having improved usability for users and administrators: from conflicts management to multiple login attacks protection, to inline editing for wiki macros, to improved pickers for the date, color, attachments, and pages. The <a href="https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWiki12CycleReleaseNotes">12.x cycle</a> focused on inline and real-time editing, page likes, notifications, not to mention a lot of performance updates. In total, we managed to have over 1578 issues closed: 763 bugs, 288 improvements, 79 new features, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      CryptPad had <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/">38 releases</a>. There are big improvements to the tools that are most essential to effectively coordinate distributed groups of people, namely rich text, spreadsheet, and kanban apps. The admin panel was further developed to ensure that community instances can be governed by team members.
