    <h3>Releases</h3>
    <p>
      Since we last had a FOSDEM stand (2021): XWiki underwent one development cycle. The <a href="https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWiki13CycleReleaseNotes">13.x cycle</a> is defined by having introduced several new features and improvements: from a new live Data rendering macro, a new "translate page" button, and link to in-place editor to global notificator filters and more flavor changes such as an increased maximum size for pages title, reference and short strings, administrator being able to access user notification settings, annotations on content generated by the HTML macro. In total, we managed to have over 682 issues closed: 310 bugs, 88 improvements, 24 new features, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      CryptPad had <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/">17 releases</a>. The beginning of 2021 welcomed CryptPad 4.0.0 with a full rebrand, which was the culmination of a great deal of work in search of the right metaphors and imagery to clearly represent what CryptPad is all about. There were also significant improvements to the tools that are most essential to effectively coordinate distributed groups of people, namely a new forms application, calendar, improvements for instance admins and better mobile support. In addition to these "big" features, many other improvements have been made to refine the stability, performance, and ease of use of CryptPad.
